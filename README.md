# Wireless Communication Techniques - Lab Exercises

Welcome to my repository! This project contains lab exercises that I developed as part of the **Wireless Communication Techniques** course. As a student exploring modern wireless systems, I created this repository to document my learning process and to share resources with others who are passionate about wireless communication. This repository will guide you through various key concepts by using hands-on MATLAB simulations.

## Why I Created This Repo

Wireless communication systems like 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi, and IoT play a central role in our daily lives, but understanding the technology behind them can be challenging. This repository provides practical coding exercises designed to make complex wireless communication techniques easier to grasp, with a focus on real-world applications such as signal propagation, antenna technology, and wireless localization.


## Overview

Here are the specific labs youâ€™ll find in this repository:
1. **Radio Transmission**
2. **Multipath Propagation Indoors**
3. **Signal Fading in Mobile Communication**
4. **Antenna Beamforming Techniques**
5. **Wireless Localization Techniques**
6. **Active Radar**
7. **Passive Localization**



Each lab involves writing and running **MATLAB** code to simulate key wireless communication scenarios by:
- Implementing real-world simulations that demonstrate how wireless technologies work.
- Analyzing the performance of different wireless systems under various conditions.
- Gaining hands-on experience with concepts like signal propagation, fading, beamforming, and radar.
